# Bamazon

# Overview

This application implements a command line based virutal store for a user to purchase items from a database. The NPM Inquirer package and MySQL are used in this application. MySQL is needed to run this application. 

# Customer View

When the customer runs the file, they are presented with a list of available items to purchase. These are pulled from the MySQL database. After entering an item to purchase, they are then asked how many they would like. Once being notified or a successful purchase, the quantity is updated in the system to reflect the recent purchase. In the below example, I purchased 999 copies of The Winds of Winter. The database updates to show that only 1 remaining copy is available after my large purchase.
